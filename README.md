# Data-Sci-projects---2020

#### This is one of the first machine learning projects I'd done - predicting churn on a Telecom dataset using a variety of regression and classification models. It doesn't make much sense to apply regression to predict a feature that is either 0 or 1, but this was just part of building a codebase for all the models I had learnt about until that point. 

#### Will soon be updated for better readability, other parts of this project (this is just one week's work, part of a much bigger ML project) will be included, etc.

##### Nov 2020 - Jan 2021
